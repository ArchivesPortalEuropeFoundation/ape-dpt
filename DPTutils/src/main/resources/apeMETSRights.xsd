     - the @targetNamespace and @xmlns attributes point to the according locations for the Archives
       Portal Europe

     - <xs:documentation> has been added for @OTHERCATEGORYTYPE
     - <RightsHolderName> has been made mandatory in apeMETSRights

     - the detailed definition of @PHONETYPE has been separated from the <xs:element name="RightsHolderContactPhone"
       to fit with the encoding of the other elements and attributes in the schema
     - <xs:documentation> has been added for @PHONETYPE
     - for @PHONETYPE the value of <xs:restriction@base> has been changed from xs:string to xs:token
       in order to restrict the set of possible values
     - the <xs:documentation> for <Context> has been adapted with notes on values for <ConstraintDescription> 
       and @OTHERCONSTRAINTTYPE, which are used specifically in apeMETSRights 
     - <Permissions> has been made mandatory in apeMETSRights

            <xs:documentation>The apeMETSRights schema is meant to be used in conjunction with the
                apeMETS schema as defined in the context of the Archives Portal Europe
                (http://www.archivesportaleurope.net/Portal/profiles/apeMETS.xsd). Based on the
                RightsDeclarationMD Extension Schema it allows the documentation of minimal
                administrative metadata about the intellectual rights associated with a digital
                object or its parts. RightsDeclarationMD contains the following top level elements:
                1. RightsDeclaration: intellectual property rights associated with digital asset or
                part of a digital asset; 2. the mandatory RightsHolder: person or organisation
                holding some intellectual property rights to a given digital asset or part of a
                digital asset; 3. Context: contains a description of specific circumstances
                associated with who has what permissions and constraints. RightsDeclarationMD also
                contains three attributes, "RIGHTSDECID", "RIGHTSCATEGORY" and "OTHERCATEGORYTYPE".
                "RIGHTSDECID provides a unique identifier for the rights declaration described.
                "RIGHTSCATEGORY" specifies whether the resource is COPYRIGHTED, LICENSED, in the
                PUBLIC DOMAIN, CONTRACTUAL, or OTHER which can be more fully described in the
                "OTHERCATEGORYTYPE" attribute. RightsDeclarationMD also contains mandatory
                attributes pointing to the apeMETSRights namespace and schema location as well as
                the namespace for the XML Schema instance:
                xmlns="http://www.archivesportaleurope.net/Portal/profiles/rights/"
                xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

            <xs:documentation>The "Context" element describes who has what permissions and
                contraints within a specific set of circumstances. "Context" includes four
                attributes, " CONTEXTID", an optional attribute which can be used to assign a unique
                identifier for the circumstance described, "RIGHTSHOLDERIDS", an optional attribute
                which provides a means to specifically list the unique identifiers of one or more
                RightsHolders who are involved in the Context scenario to be described,
                "CONTEXTCLASS", and "OTHERCONTEXTTYPE". By means of the required "CONTEXTCLASS"
                attribute, the group is defined to which a given context relates. Enumerated values
                for this attribute include "ACADEMIC USER", "GENERAL PUBLIC","REPOSITORY MGR",
                "MANAGED GRP", "INSTITUTIONAL AFFILIATE", "OTHER". Local extensions to "OTHER"
                context classes can be described in the "OTHERCONTEXTTYPE" attribute, as desired.
                "Context" also contains three elements which further describe a specified context.
                The element "UserName" allows the naming of the typical user or group who would use
                the digital object within the described context. The kind of user being named can be
                described by means of the attribute "USERTYPE" which has values "INDIVIDUAL",
                "GROUP", "BOTH", or "UNDEFINED". The element "Permissions" describes a set of uses
                to which a digital object or part thereof can be put as defined by the rights holder
                in a given context. "Permissions" has nine attributes which describe the type of
                permissions including "DISCOVER", "DISPLAY", "COPY", "DUPLICATE", "MODIFY",
                "DELETE", "PRINT", "OTHER", and "OTHERPERMITTYPE" which allows the addition of local
                types of permissions not included in the general list. Any restrictions that need to
                be placed upon a set of permissions are described by the use of the "Constraints"
                element. The "Constraints" element contains a "ConstraintDescription" sub-element
                that is used with a set of fixed values corresponding to the Creative Commons
                licences ("SA", "NC", "ND" and "NC-SA" and "NC-ND"). The "Constraints" element has
                an attribute "CONSTRAINTTYPE" which characterises the type of restrictions imposed
                upon the users within a given context. Enumerated values for the CONSTRAINTTYPE
                attributes include "QUALITY", "FORMAT", "UNIT", "WATERMARK", "PAYMENT", "COUNT",
                "ATTRIBUTION", "RE-USE", "TIME", "TRANSFERPERMISSIONS", "OTHER". As value for the
                "OTHERCONSTRAINTTYPE" attribute "RESTRICTED ACCESS" has been defined for apeMETSRights. </xs:documentation>

                a user is allowed to do (or not to do) with a digital or digitised object. All
                attributes can be used with the values "true" and "false" to indicate if a certain
                action is possible and allowed. A "true" for @DISCOVER states that the resource is
                available for searching or other discovery activities. A "true" for @DISPLAY states
                that the resource can be rendered, played and executed. A "true" for @COPY states
                that it is allowed to make a verbatim copy for purposes of re-use of the whole or a
                part of the resource and to create of new resource with this copy. A "true" for
                @DUPLICATE states that it is allowed to make exact copy of resource for file or
                repository management purposes. A "true" for @MODIFY states that it is allowed to
                annotate, edit, excerpt, embed, extract resource for purposes of re-use or
                preservation. A "true" for @DELETE states that it is allowed to remove the resource
                from the repository for purposes of resource or repository management. A "true" for
                @PRINT states that it is allowed to render the resource onto paper or hard copy. A
                "true" for @OTHER indicates that there is further information on permissions, which
                are specified with the @OTHERPERMITTYPE attribute allowing for naming localised
                permission types. </xs:documentation>

                <xs:documentation>The attribute @CONSTRAINTTYPE is used to characterise the type
                    of constraints imposed on a digital object. Depending on the value used, it can
                    be specified, that the digital object has been provided in lower "QUALITY", that
                    it is only available in a certain "FORMAT", that it is only used in context of a
                    certain "UNIT", that there is a "WATERMARK" on the object, that the use of the
                    object is related to a certain "PAYMENT", that there is a "COUNT" connected to
                    how often the same user uses the object for the same purpose, that "RE-USE"
                    might be constraint with certain conditions, that "ATTRIBUTION" is required,
                    that there is a limit in "TIME" for the use of an object, that there are certain
                    "TRANSFERPERMISSIONS" to comply to or that there are "OTHER" constraints. When apeMETSRights
                    is used in the context of the Archives Portal Europe, it is recommended to especially
                    use the values "PAYMENT", "RE-USE" and "ATTRIBUTION" as well as "OTHER" to complement
                    the different rights statements that have been defined for this central infrastructure
                    and an exchange with Europeana.
