# Archives Portal Europe Data Preparation Tool (DPT)

This is the main project for the DPT, a standalone tool, which can be used by content providers to prepare their data locally before upload to the portal.

This tool has to be built before building any other Archives Portal Europe projects.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
There is an issue with the code not compiling under Java 8. This is caused by Javadoc generated by an external tool for some of the classes which is not in compliance with doclint. As a temporary workaround, make sure to add -Xdoclint:none to the argument list of your compiler.
